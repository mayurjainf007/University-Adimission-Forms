# University Adimission Forms
This project introduces the UNIVERSITY ADMISSION SYSTEM which is a window based application. The aim of this project is to create a platform where students can apply for their admission in the university. They can register themselves on the main university page and later can fill the admission form by logging in the student portal. Later when the cut-offs are declared by the administrator, students will get informed in the notification panel about the seat allotted to them. Also a fee receipt can be generated, after the student has paid the fees. The system uses Oracle as a database for storing the various valuable information.

The project is based on the core concepts of JAVA programming language. Features of Java that are included are encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and reusability of the code is also done properly. The graphical user interface is built through swing package. The source code also includes general programming features like if-else and various string methods. The graphical user interface of this project allows the user or students to fill the admission form, change their password, pay the fees. The administrator has complete access over the database. He/She is the one who sets the cut-offs for the admission.
